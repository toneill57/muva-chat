# 📦 Archive - Historical Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation, completed projects, and one-off scripts that are no longer actively used but may provide context or be useful for reference.

## Structure

```

├── migrations/        # Historical database migrations
├── analysis/          # Analysis documents and reports

├── scripts-uncategorized/  # Scripts pending further categorization
├── legacy/            # Legacy code and documentation
├── legacy-migrations/ # Old migration files
└── backups/          # Database backups
```

## Notable Contents

### Projects

## Usage

These files are archived for reference only. If you need to:

1. **Restore a script**: Copy it to the appropriate active directory under `/scripts/`
2. **Reference old documentation**: Use for context but create new docs in `/docs/`
3. **Understand project history**: Review project folders for implementation details

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Do not execute scripts directly from this directory** - They may be outdated or incompatible with current code.

✅ **For active development**, use the organized scripts in `/scripts/` and documentation in `/docs/`
